# AI Search Algorithms - BFS and DFS

This repository contains Python implementations of Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) applied to two classic AI puzzles:

## 🔹 1. Rabbit Jump Puzzle
- A problem based on a rabbit jumping toward its goal state with limited moves.
- Both BFS and DFS approaches implemented.

## 🔹 2. Bridge Crossing Puzzle
- Puzzle where people with different speeds must cross a bridge in limited time.
- BFS is used to find the shortest time, and DFS explores alternate strategies.

## 🚀 Tech Used:
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Files:
- `rabbit_jump_puzzle.ipynb`
- `bridge_crossing_puzzle.ipynb`
